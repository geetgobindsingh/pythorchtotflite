# pythorchtotflite
pythorch to tflite

## Project Description
The "pythorchtotflite" project is aimed at converting face matching models originally implemented in PyTorch to TensorFlow Lite format. This enables the deployment of these models on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones and edge devices. Additionally, the project includes a model evaluation component that uses the device camera to assess model performance.

## Features
- Model Conversion: This project focuses on the conversion of face matching models from PyTorch to TensorFlow Lite. The conversion process is essential for making models suitable for deployment on mobile and edge devices.
- Model Evaluation: The project provides the capability to evaluate the performance of converted models by utilizing the device's camera. This allows you to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
